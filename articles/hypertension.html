      <h1>High Blood Pressure</h1>
      <p class="article-hero__subtitle">The "silent killer" — most people have no symptoms, but untreated hypertension seriously damages your heart, kidneys, and brain over time.</p>
    </div>

        <section class="article-section" id="what-is-it">
          <h2>What Is High Blood Pressure?</h2>
          <p>Blood pressure is the force of blood pushing against the walls of your arteries as your heart pumps. It's measured with two numbers — for example, 120/80. The top number (systolic) measures pressure when your heart beats; the bottom number (diastolic) measures pressure between beats.</p>
          <p>High blood pressure — or hypertension — means the force is consistently too high. Over time, this damages artery walls, forces the heart to work harder, and can lead to heart attack, stroke, kidney disease, and heart failure.</p>
          <div class="info-box">
            <p><strong>Blood pressure categories (American Heart Association):</strong><br/>
            Normal: Less than 120/80 mmHg<br/>
            Elevated: 120–129 / less than 80<br/>
            High (Stage 1): 130–139 / 80–89<br/>
            High (Stage 2): 140+ / 90+<br/>
            Crisis: 180+ / 120+ — seek emergency care immediately</p>
          </div>
          <p>About 1 in 2 American adults has high blood pressure. Most don't know it. That's why regular checkups matter so much.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="article-section" id="symptoms">
          <h2>Symptoms</h2>
          <p>This is what makes hypertension so dangerous: <strong>most people feel completely normal.</strong> There are usually no warning signs until significant damage has already occurred.</p>
          <p>In rare cases of very high blood pressure (hypertensive crisis), people may experience:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Severe headache</li>
            <li>Blurred or double vision</li>
            <li>Nosebleeds</li>
            <li>Shortness of breath</li>
            <li>Chest pain</li>
            <li>Dizziness or lightheadedness</li>
          </ul>
          <div class="warning-box">
            <div class="warning-box__title">⚠️ Don't Wait for Symptoms</div>
            <p>The absence of symptoms does not mean your blood pressure is fine. The only way to know is to measure it. Get it checked regularly — at least once a year if you're healthy, more often if you have risk factors.</p>
          </div>
        </section>

        <section class="article-section" id="diagnosis">
          <h2>How Is It Diagnosed?</h2>
          <p>Diagnosis is straightforward: a blood pressure cuff reading. But one high reading doesn't automatically mean hypertension — blood pressure naturally varies throughout the day based on activity, stress, and other factors.</p>
          <p>Your doctor will typically:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Take multiple readings on separate visits before diagnosing hypertension</li>
            <li>Ask about your medical history, family history, and lifestyle</li>
            <li>Order blood and urine tests to check kidney function, cholesterol, and blood sugar</li>
            <li>Order an EKG to check if the heart has been affected</li>
            <li>Sometimes recommend home blood pressure monitoring</li>
          </ul>
          <p>In a small percentage of cases, high blood pressure has an underlying cause (like kidney disease or a hormonal disorder). Your doctor may investigate these if your hypertension is severe or hard to control.</p>

        <section class="article-section" id="treatment">
          <h2>Treatment Options</h2>
          <p>The good news: high blood pressure is very treatable. Most people can get it under control with a combination of lifestyle changes and medication.</p>

          <h3 style="margin: 1.25rem 0 0.75rem;">Lifestyle Changes</h3>
          <p>These can lower blood pressure significantly — sometimes enough to avoid medication:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Reduce sodium:</strong> Aim for less than 2,300 mg/day (ideally 1,500 mg). Processed foods are the biggest culprit.</li>
            <li><strong>DASH diet:</strong> Rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and low-fat dairy — proven to lower blood pressure.</li>
            <li><strong>Exercise regularly:</strong> 30 minutes of moderate activity most days can lower systolic blood pressure by 5–8 mmHg.</li>
            <li><strong>Limit alcohol:</strong> No more than 1 drink/day for women, 2 for men.</li>
            <li><strong>Quit smoking:</strong> Each cigarette temporarily spikes blood pressure and damages blood vessels.</li>
            <li><strong>Manage stress:</strong> Chronic stress contributes to hypertension. Mindfulness, sleep, and exercise all help.</li>
            <li><strong>Lose weight if needed:</strong> Even a 10-pound loss can meaningfully reduce blood pressure.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 style="margin: 1.25rem 0 0.75rem;">Medications</h3>
          <p>When lifestyle changes aren't enough, medications are safe, effective, and widely used. Common classes include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>ACE inhibitors / ARBs</strong> (e.g., lisinopril, losartan) — relax blood vessels; often first-line</li>
            <li><strong>Calcium channel blockers</strong> (e.g., amlodipine) — relax artery walls</li>
            <li><strong>Thiazide diuretics</strong> (e.g., hydrochlorothiazide) — reduce fluid volume</li>
            <li><strong>Beta-blockers</strong> (e.g., metoprolol) — slow the heart rate and reduce output</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Many people need more than one medication. That's completely normal and doesn't mean your case is severe.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="article-section" id="when-to-seek-care">
          <h2>When to Seek Care</h2>
          <div class="emergency-box">
            <div class="emergency-box__title">🚨 Call 911 if your blood pressure reads 180/120 or higher AND you have:</div>
            <ul>
              <li>Severe chest pain</li>
              <li>Sudden difficulty breathing</li>
              <li>Sudden weakness or numbness in the face, arm, or leg</li>
              <li>Sudden vision changes</li>
              <li>Sudden severe headache with no known cause</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <p style="margin-top:1.25rem;">See your doctor if: you've never had your blood pressure checked, home readings are consistently above 130/80, or you're having trouble tolerating your current medications. Don't stop medications without talking to your doctor first.</p>
