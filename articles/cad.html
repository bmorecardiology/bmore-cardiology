          <h2>What Is Coronary Artery Disease?</h2>
          <p>Your heart is a muscle, and like all muscles, it needs a constant supply of oxygen-rich blood to work properly. The coronary arteries are the vessels that deliver that blood. Coronary artery disease (CAD) occurs when these arteries become narrowed or blocked by a buildup of plaque — a sticky mixture of cholesterol, fat, calcium, and other substances.</p>
          <p>This process is called <strong>atherosclerosis</strong>, and it develops slowly over decades — often starting in young adulthood. As plaque accumulates, it narrows the artery and reduces blood flow to the heart muscle. If a plaque ruptures, a blood clot can form suddenly and completely block the artery — causing a heart attack.</p>
          <div class="info-box">
            <p><strong>CAD is the #1 killer in the United States.</strong> About 20 million American adults have it, and it causes roughly 1 in every 5 deaths. The good news: it's largely preventable, and once diagnosed, very treatable.</p>
          </div>
        </section>

        <section class="article-section" id="symptoms">
          <h2>Symptoms</h2>
          <p>CAD can be completely silent for years. The first symptom in many people is a heart attack. When symptoms do occur, the most common is <strong>angina</strong> — chest discomfort caused by reduced blood flow to the heart.</p>
          <p>Angina typically feels like:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Pressure, squeezing, tightness, or heaviness in the chest</li>
            <li>Pain that may spread to the left arm, shoulder, jaw, neck, or back</li>
            <li>Discomfort that comes on with exertion or stress and goes away with rest</li>
            <li>Episodes that last a few minutes and resolve</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Other symptoms of CAD or reduced heart blood flow include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Shortness of breath with activity</li>
            <li>Unusual fatigue</li>
            <li>Dizziness or lightheadedness</li>
          </ul>
          <div class="warning-box">
            <div class="warning-box__title">⚠️ Women May Have Different Symptoms</div>
            <p>Women are more likely to experience atypical symptoms like nausea, jaw pain, back pain, or extreme fatigue — without the classic chest pressure. These symptoms deserve the same medical attention.</p>
          </div>
        </section>

        <section class="article-section" id="diagnosis">
          <h2>How Is It Diagnosed?</h2>
          <p>Your doctor will assess your risk factors, symptoms, and test results to determine how much CAD you may have and how severe it is.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>EKG:</strong> Can show signs of a prior heart attack or reduced blood flow</li>
            <li><strong>Stress test:</strong> You exercise on a treadmill while your heart is monitored — reduced blood flow shows up as EKG changes or symptoms. Can be combined with imaging (nuclear stress test or stress echo) for more detail.</li>
            <li><strong>Coronary CT angiography (CCTA):</strong> A CT scan that produces detailed images of the coronary arteries, showing how much plaque is present and whether arteries are narrowed. Increasingly used as a first-line test.</li>
            <li><strong>Cardiac catheterization (coronary angiogram):</strong> The gold standard. A thin tube is guided to the coronary arteries and dye is injected to show blockages in real time. Also allows for treatment at the same time.</li>
            <li><strong>Coronary artery calcium (CAC) score:</strong> A CT scan that measures calcified plaque — a strong predictor of future heart attack risk. Helpful for guiding treatment in people with borderline risk.</li>
            <li><strong>Blood tests:</strong> Cholesterol panel, blood sugar, and inflammatory markers help assess overall cardiovascular risk.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="article-section" id="treatment">
          <h2>Treatment Options</h2>
          <p>Treatment depends on the severity of CAD. The goals are to relieve symptoms, slow or reverse plaque buildup, and prevent heart attacks.</p>

          <h3 style="margin: 1.25rem 0 0.75rem;">Lifestyle Changes (Essential for Everyone)</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Heart-healthy diet:</strong> Mediterranean or plant-forward diet reduces plaque progression. Limit saturated fat, trans fat, red meat, and refined sugars.</li>
            <li><strong>Exercise:</strong> At least 150 minutes of moderate activity per week improves heart function and reduces risk.</li>
            <li><strong>Quit smoking:</strong> The single most impactful change you can make. Smoking dramatically accelerates atherosclerosis.</li>
            <li><strong>Manage blood pressure and diabetes:</strong> Both accelerate artery damage.</li>
            <li><strong>Reach a healthy weight:</strong> Reduces strain on the heart and improves cholesterol and blood pressure.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 style="margin: 1.25rem 0 0.75rem;">Medications</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Statins</strong> (e.g., atorvastatin, rosuvastatin): Lower LDL cholesterol and stabilize plaque. Proven to reduce heart attacks and death in CAD patients.</li>
            <li><strong>Aspirin or other antiplatelets:</strong> Prevent blood clots from forming on plaque. Used selectively based on individual risk/benefit.</li>
            <li><strong>Beta-blockers:</strong> Reduce heart rate and workload; help with angina and post-heart attack.</li>
            <li><strong>ACE inhibitors / ARBs:</strong> Protect the heart and kidneys; often used after heart attack.</li>
            <li><strong>Nitrates</strong> (e.g., nitroglycerin): Relieve angina episodes by dilating blood vessels.</li>
            <li><strong>PCSK9 inhibitors:</strong> Injectable medications for very high cholesterol not controlled by statins.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 style="margin: 1.25rem 0 0.75rem;">Procedures</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>PCI (Percutaneous Coronary Intervention / stenting):</strong> A catheter with a tiny balloon opens a blocked artery; a stent (small mesh tube) is placed to keep it open. Done in the cath lab — minimally invasive.</li>
            <li><strong>CABG (Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting):</strong> Open-heart surgery that creates new routes around blocked arteries using vessels from elsewhere in the body. Recommended for severe multi-vessel disease.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>When to Seek Care</h2>
          <div class="emergency-box">
            <div class="emergency-box__title">🚨 Call 911 immediately — these are signs of a heart attack:</div>
            <ul>
              <li>Chest pain, pressure, tightness, or squeezing lasting more than a few minutes</li>
              <li>Pain spreading to the arm, shoulder, jaw, neck, or back</li>
              <li>Sudden shortness of breath</li>
              <li>Cold sweat, nausea, or lightheadedness with chest discomfort</li>
              <li>Sudden extreme fatigue (especially in women)</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <p style="margin-top:1.25rem;">Time is muscle. Every minute during a heart attack, more heart tissue is damaged. Don't drive yourself — call 911. Don't wait to see if the pain goes away on its own.</p>
          <p>Schedule an appointment with your doctor if: you have risk factors (high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, smoking, family history) and have never had a cardiovascular risk assessment; or you notice any new chest discomfort, shortness of breath, or reduced exercise capacity.</p>
