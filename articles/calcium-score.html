          <h2>What Is a Coronary Artery Calcium Score?</h2>
          <p>A coronary artery calcium (CAC) score — sometimes called a "calcium score" or "heart scan" — is a specialized CT scan that measures the amount of calcified plaque in the walls of the arteries that supply your heart. It takes about 10–15 minutes, requires no dye or needles, and gives your doctor a concrete number that reflects how much plaque has already built up in your coronary arteries.</p>
          <p>Calcium deposits in artery walls are a hallmark of atherosclerosis — the process where plaque accumulates over time and narrows blood vessels. Where there's calcium, there's plaque. The more calcium, the more plaque, and the higher the risk of a heart attack down the road.</p>
          <div class="info-box">
            <p><strong>Think of it as a "plaque report card" for your heart.</strong> Standard risk calculators estimate your future risk based on factors like age, cholesterol, and blood pressure. The CAC score tells you what's actually happening inside your arteries right now — making it one of the most powerful tools in preventive cardiology.</p>
          </div>
        </section>

        <section class="article-section" id="the-score">
          <h2>Understanding Your Score</h2>
          <p>The result is reported as a number — the Agatston score — calculated based on the density and volume of calcium deposits found. Here's what the numbers mean:</p>

          <div class="info-box" style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">
            <p>
              <strong>0 — No detectable plaque.</strong> Very low risk of heart attack in the next 10 years. Reassuring, but not a permanent pass — lifestyle still matters.<br/><br/>
              <strong>1–99 — Mild plaque.</strong> Some plaque is present. Low to moderate risk. Lifestyle changes and close monitoring are key. Medication may be considered.<br/><br/>
              <strong>100–299 — Moderate plaque.</strong> Meaningful plaque burden. Moderate to high risk. Most guidelines recommend starting a statin at this level if not already on one.<br/><br/>
              <strong>300+ — Extensive plaque.</strong> High risk. Aggressive risk factor management is essential — this group benefits most from preventive medications and close follow-up.<br/><br/>
              <strong>400+ — Very high risk.</strong> Associated with significantly elevated risk of heart attack. A full cardiology evaluation is warranted.
            </p>
          </div>

          <p>Your score is also compared to others of the same age, sex, and ethnicity using percentile rankings. A score that puts you in the 75th percentile or higher — even if the absolute number seems low — may still warrant more aggressive treatment.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="article-section" id="who-should-get-one">
          <h2>Who Should Get a CAC Score?</h2>
          <p>The CAC score is most useful for people in the "intermediate risk" zone — those who fall in a gray area where a doctor isn't sure whether to start preventive medications like a statin. The score helps tip the decision in one direction or the other.</p>

          <p><strong>The ACC/AHA guidelines recommend considering a CAC score for:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Adults aged 40–75 with a 10-year cardiovascular risk between 7.5–20% (intermediate risk)</li>
            <li>People who are uncertain about starting statin therapy and want more information before deciding</li>
            <li>Adults with a family history of early heart disease who want to know their personal risk</li>
            <li>People with risk factors (diabetes, hypertension, high cholesterol) who have never had a cardiac event and want a clearer risk picture</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="warning-box">
            <div class="warning-box__title">⚠️ Not for Everyone</div>
            <p>If you've already had a heart attack, bypass surgery, or stents — you already have established heart disease and don't need a CAC score. It's a screening tool for people who haven't yet had a cardiac event.</p>
          </div>

          <p>A CAC score of zero is also valuable — it's one of the most reassuring findings in preventive cardiology. Studies show that people with a zero score have an extremely low risk of heart attack over the next 10–15 years, even if other risk factors are present. This can support a decision to hold off on medications while focusing on lifestyle changes.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="article-section" id="the-test">
          <h2>What to Expect During the Test</h2>
          <p>The CAC scan is quick, painless, and requires no special preparation in most cases:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>You'll lie on a CT scanner table. The scan itself takes only a few minutes.</li>
            <li>No contrast dye is injected — unlike a coronary CT angiogram.</li>
            <li>You'll be asked to hold your breath briefly during the scan.</li>
            <li>The radiation dose is low — roughly equivalent to a mammogram.</li>
            <li>Results are typically available within a few days and reviewed with your doctor.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The test is usually done at a hospital radiology department or outpatient imaging center. It's often not covered by insurance when used for screening (i.e., no symptoms), but it typically costs $75–$200 out of pocket — a worthwhile investment for the information it provides.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="article-section" id="what-happens-next">
          <h2>What Happens After Your Score?</h2>
          <p>Your CAC score doesn't change your diagnosis — it refines your risk estimate and helps guide treatment decisions. Here's how your doctor may respond:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Score of 0:</strong> Reassurance. Focus on maintaining healthy habits. May repeat in 5 years if risk factors persist. Statin may be reasonably deferred in many cases.</li>
            <li><strong>Score of 1–99:</strong> Lifestyle counseling. Moderate-intensity statin often recommended. Close follow-up.</li>
            <li><strong>Score of 100+:</strong> High-intensity statin is generally recommended. Blood pressure and diabetes targets become more strict. Aspirin may be considered in selected patients. More frequent monitoring.</li>
            <li><strong>Score of 300+:</strong> Aggressive risk reduction. Possible additional testing. Cardiology referral if not already established.</li>
          </ul>
          <div class="info-box">
            <p><strong>Important:</strong> A CAC score is one piece of the puzzle — not the whole picture. Your doctor will interpret it in the context of your overall health, family history, lifestyle, and other test results. Never make medication decisions based on your score alone.</p>
          </div>
        </section>

        <section class="article-section" id="limitations">
          <h2>Limitations of the CAC Score</h2>
          <p>The CAC score is a powerful tool, but it's not perfect. Understanding what it <em>can't</em> tell you is just as important as understanding what it can.</p>

          <h3 style="margin: 1.25rem 0 0.75rem;">It only detects calcified plaque</h3>
          <p>The scan measures calcium deposits — a sign of older, more stable plaque. It does <em>not</em> detect soft, non-calcified plaque, which is actually more prone to rupture and cause heart attacks. A score of zero doesn't mean your arteries are completely clear — it means there's no calcified plaque yet. Young people in particular may have significant soft plaque with a zero CAC score.</p>

          <h3 style="margin: 1.25rem 0 0.75rem;">It doesn't show blockages</h3>
          <p>A high CAC score tells you there's plaque present, but it can't tell you how much any single artery is narrowed. For that, you'd need a coronary CT angiogram (CCTA) or a stress test. CAC is a risk stratification tool — not a diagnostic one.</p>

          <h3 style="margin: 1.25rem 0 0.75rem;">Limited usefulness at the extremes of age</h3>
          <p>In adults under 40, the test is rarely useful — plaque simply hasn't had time to calcify, so scores are almost always zero even if risk factors are accumulating. In adults over 75, nearly everyone has some calcium, making the score less discriminating. The sweet spot is roughly ages 40–70, where the test adds the most information beyond standard risk calculators.</p>

          <h3 style="margin: 1.25rem 0 0.75rem;">Radiation exposure (small but real)</h3>
          <p>The scan involves a low dose of radiation — roughly equivalent to a mammogram or a few chest X-rays. For most adults in the appropriate age range, the benefit of the information far outweighs this risk. However, it's a reason not to repeat the test unnecessarily.</p>

          <h3 style="margin: 1.25rem 0 0.75rem;">Not covered by insurance for screening</h3>
          <p>Most insurance plans don't cover the CAC scan when used as a screening test in asymptomatic patients. Out-of-pocket cost is typically $75–$200 — a relatively small investment for the clinical information it provides, but worth knowing in advance.</p>

          <h3 style="margin: 1.25rem 0 0.75rem;">It can cause anxiety</h3>
          <p>Finding unexpected calcium — especially in someone who felt perfectly healthy — can cause significant anxiety and may lead to downstream testing that isn't always necessary. This is why the test is most valuable when ordered thoughtfully, with a clear plan for how to act on the results.</p>

          <div class="info-box">
            <p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> The CAC score is one of the best tools we have in preventive cardiology — but it works best as part of a broader conversation with your doctor, not as a standalone test you order on your own.</p>
          </div>

        <section class="article-section" id="when-to-seek-care">
          <h2>When to Ask Your Doctor About a CAC Score</h2>
          <p>Bring it up at your next appointment if:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>You're between 40–75 and have never discussed your 10-year heart attack risk with a doctor</li>
            <li>Your doctor has suggested a statin and you're on the fence about starting one</li>
            <li>A parent or sibling had a heart attack before age 55 (men) or 65 (women)</li>
            <li>You have multiple risk factors but feel fine and want a clearer picture of where you stand</li>
            <li>You want a more personalized, data-driven approach to your heart health</li>
          </ul>

            <div class="emergency-box__title">🚨 The CAC score is for prevention — not emergencies.</div>
            <p style="margin-top: 0.5rem;">If you're having chest pain, shortness of breath, or any symptoms that concern you right now, call 911 or go to an emergency room. Don't schedule a scan.</p>
